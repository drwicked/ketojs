"adopt" 		: "Adopt|\"He adopted a disguise.\" One may adopt a child, or an opinion, but a disguise is assumed.",
"afford" 		: "Afford|It is not well to say \"the fact affords a reasonable presumption\"; \"the house afforded ample accommodation.\" The fact supplies a reasonable presumption. The house offered, or gave, ample accommodation.",
"afraid" 		: "Afraid|Do not say, \"I am afraid it will rain.\" Say, I fear that it will rain.",
"aggravate" 	: "Aggravate for Irritate|\"He aggravated me by his insolence.\" To aggravate is to augment the disagreeableness of something already disagreeable, or the badness of something bad. But a person cannot be aggravated, even if disagreeable or bad. Women are singularly prone to misuse of this word.",
"all of" 		: "All of|\"He gave all of his property.\" The words are contradictory: an entire thing cannot be of itself. Omit the preposition.",
"alleged" 		: "Alleged|\"The alleged murderer.\" One can allege a murder, but not a murderer; a crime, but not a criminal. A man that is merely suspected of crime would not, in any case, be an alleged criminal, for an allegation is a definite and positive statement. In their tiresome addiction to this use of alleged, the newspapers, though having mainly in mind the danger of libel suits, can urge in further justification the lack of any other single word that exactly expresses their meaning; but the fact that a mud-puddle supplies the shortest route is not a compelling reason for walking through it. One can go around.",
"allow" 		: "Allow for Permit|\"I allow you to go.\" Precision is better attained by saying permit, for allow has other meanings.",
"allude to" 	: "Allude to for Mention|What is alluded to is not mentioned, but referred to indirectly. Originally, the word implied a playful, or sportive, reference. That meaning is gone out of it.",
"and so" 		: "And so/And yet|\"And so they were married.\" \"And yet a woman.\" Omit the conjunction.",
"and which" 	: "And which/And who|These forms are incorrect unless the relative pronoun has been used previously in the sentence. \"The colt, spirited and strong, and which was unbroken, escaped from the pasture.\" \"John Smith, one of our leading merchants, and who fell from a window yesterday, died this morning.\" Omit the conjunction.",
"anticipate" 	: "Anticipate for Expect|\"I anticipate trouble.\" To anticipate is to act on an expectation in a way to promote or forestall the event expected.",
"anxious" 		: "Anxious for Eager|\"I was anxious to go.\" Anxious should not be followed by an infinitive. Anxiety is contemplative; eagerness, alert for action.",
"appreciate" 	: "Appreciate for Highly Value|In the sense of value, it means value justly, not highly. In another and preferable sense it means to increase in value.",
"approach" 		: "Approach|\"The juror was approached\"; that is, overtures were made to him with a view to bribing him. As there is no other single word for it, approach is made to serve, figuratively; and being graphic, it is not altogether objectionable.",

"casket" 		: "Casket for Coffin|A needless euphemism affected by undertakers.",
"casualties" 	: "Casualties for Losses in Battle. The essence of casualty is accident, absence of design. Death and wounds in battle are produced otherwise, are expectable and expected, and, by the enemy, intentional.",

It is ingeniously defended on the ground that on that day those on whom degrees are bestowed commence to hold them. Lovely!",
"commit suicide": "Commit Suicide|Instead of \"He committed suicide,\" say, He killed himself, or, He took his life. For married we do not say \"committed matrimony.\" Unfortunately most of us do say, \"got married,\" which is almost as bad. For lack of a suitable verb we just sometimes say committed this or that, as in the instance of bigamy, for the verb to bigam is a blessing that is still in store for us.",
"compare with" 	: "Compare with for Compare to|\"He had the immodesty to compare himself with Shakespeare.\" Nothing necessarily immodest in that. Comparison with may be for observing a difference; comparison to affirms a similarity.",

"continually" 	: "Continually and Continuously|It seems that these words should have the same meaning, but in their use by good writers there is a difference. What is done continually is not done all the time, but continuous action is without interruption.

"continuously" 	: "Continually and Continuously|It seems that these words should have the same meaning, but in their use by good writers there is a difference.

"couple" 		: "Couple for Two|For two things to be a couple they must be of one general kind, and their number unimportant to the statement made of them. It would be weak to say, \"He gave me only one, although he took a couple for himself.\" Couple expresses indifference to the exact number, as does several. That is true, even in the phrase, a married couple, for the number is carried in the adjective and needs no emphasis.",
"critically" 	: "Critically for Seriously|\"He has long been critically ill.\" A patient is critically ill only at the crisis of his disease.",
"criticise" 	: "Criticise for Condemn or Disparage|Criticism is not necessarily censorious; it may approve.",

"deprivation" 	: "Deprivation for Privation|\"The mendicant showed the effects of deprivation.\" Deprivation refers to the act of depriving, taking away from; privation is the state of destitution, of not having.",
"dilapidated" 	: "Dilapidated for Ruined|Said of a building, or other structure. But the word is from the Latin lapis: a stone, and cannot properly be used of any but a stone structure.",
"directly" 		: "Directly for Immediately|\"I will come directly\" means that I will come by the most direct route.",

"doubtlessly" 	: "Doubtlessly|A doubly adverbial form, like \"illy.\"",
"dress" 		: "Dress for Gown|Not so common as it was a few years ago. Dress means the entire costume.",
"each other" 	: "Each Other for One Another|\"The three looked at each other.\" That is, each looked at the other. But there were more than one other; so we should say they looked at one another, which means that each looked at another. Of two, say each other; of more than two, one another.",
"edify" 		: "Edify for Please or Entertain|Edify means to build; it has, therefore, the sense of uplift, improvement--usually moral, or spiritual.",
"electrocution" : "Electrocution|To one having even an elementary knowledge of Latin grammar this word is no less than disgusting, and the thing meant by it is felt to be altogether too good for the word\"s inventor.",
"empty" 		: "Empty for Vacant|Say, an empty bottle; but, a vacant house.",
"endorse" 		: "Endorse for Approve|To endorse is to write upon the back of, or to sign the promissory note of another. It is a commercial word, having insufficient dignity for literary use. You may endorse a check, but you approve a policy, or statement.",
"endways" 		: "Endways|A corruption of endwise.",
"entitled" 		: "Entitled for Authorized|Privileged. \"The man is not entitled to draw rations.\" Say, entitled to rations. Entitled is not to be followed by an infinitive.",
"episode" 		: "Episode for Occurrence, Event etc. Properly, an episode is a narrative that is a subordinate part of another narrative. An occurrence considered by itself is not an episode.",
"equally as" 	: "Equally as for Equally|\"This is equally as good.\" Omit as. \"He was of the same age, and equally as tall.\" Say, equally tall.",
"equivalent" 	: "Equivalent for Equal|\"My salary is equivalent to yours.\"",
"essential" 	: "Essential for Necessary|This solecism is common among the best writers of this country and England. \"It is essential to go early\"; \"Irrigation is essential to cultivation of arid lands,\" and so forth. One thing is essential to another thing only if it is of the essence of it--an important and indispensable part of it, determining its nature; the soul of it.",
"even" 			: "Even for Exact|\"An even dozen.\"",
"ex" 			: "Ex/\"Ex-President,\" \"an ex-convict,\" and the like. Say, former. In England one may say, Mr. Roosevelt, sometime President; though the usage is a trifle archaic.",
"example" 		: "Example for Problem|A heritage from the text-books. \"An example in arithmetic.\" An equally bad word for the same thing is \"sum\": \"Do the sum,\" for Solve the problem.",
"excessively" 	: "Excessively for Exceedingly|\"The disease is excessively painful.\" \"The weather is excessively cold.\" Anything that is painful at all is excessively so. Even a slight degree or small amount of what is disagreeable or injurious is excessive--that is to say, redundant, superfluous, not required.",
"executed" 		: "Executed|\"The condemned man was executed.\" He was hanged, or otherwise put to death; it is the sentence that is executed.",
"executive" 	: "Executive for Secret|An executive session of a deliberative body is a session for executive business, as distinguished from legislative. It is commonly secret, but a secret session is not necessarily executive.",
"expect" 		: "Expect for Believe or Suppose|\"I expect he will go.\" Say, I believe (suppose or think) he will go; or, I expect him to go.",
"expectorate" 	: "Expectorate for Spit|The former word is frequently used, even in laws and ordinances, as a euphemism for the latter. It not only means something entirely different, but to one with a Latin ear is far more offensive.",
"extend" 		: "Extend for Proffer|\"He extended an invitation.\" One does not always hold out an invitation in one\"s hand; it may be spoken or sent. ",
"fail" 			: "Fail|\"He failed to note the hour.\" That implies that he tried to note it, but did not succeed. Failure carries always the sense of endeavor; when there has been no endeavor there is no failure. A falling stone cannot fail to strike you, for it does not try; but a marksman firing at you may fail to hit you; and I hope he always will.",
"feel of" 		: "Feel of for Feel|\"The doctor felt of the patient\"s head.\" \"Smell of\" and \"taste of\" are incorrect too.",
"feminine" 		: "Feminine for Female|\"A feminine member of the club.\" Feminine refers, not to sex proper, but to gender, which may be defined as the sex of words. The same is true of masculine.",

"financial" 	: "Financial for Pecuniary|\"His financial reward\"; \"he is financially responsible,\" and so forth.",

"forebears" 	: "Forebears for Ancestors|The word is sometimes spelled forbears, a worse spelling than the other, but not much. If used at all it should be spelled forebeers; for it means those who have been before. A forebe-er is one who fore-was. Considered in any way, it is a senseless word.",
"forecasted" 	: "Forecasted|For this abominable word we are indebted to the weather bureau--at least it was not sent upon us until that affliction was with us. Let us hope that it may some day be losted from the language.",
"former" 		: "Former and Latter|Indicating the first and the second of things previously named, these words are unobjectionable if not too far removed from the names that they stand for. If they are they confuse, for the reader has to look back to the names. Use them sparingly.",
"fully" 		: "Fully for Definitively or Finally|\"After many preliminary examinations he was fully committed for trial.\" The adverb is meaningless: a defendant is never partly committed for trial. This is a solecism to which lawyers are addicted. And sometimes they have been heard to say \"fullied.\"",
"funds" 		: "Funds for Money|\"He was out of funds.\" Funds are not money in general, but sums of money or credit available for particular purposes.",
"furnish" 		: "Furnish for Provide or Supply|\"Taxation furnished the money.\" A pauper may furnish a house if some one will provide the furniture, or the money to buy it. \"His flight furnishes a presumption of guilt.\" It supplies it.",
"generally" 	: "Generally for Usually|\"The winds are generally high.\" \"A fool is generally vain.\" This misuse of the word appears to come of abbreviating: Generally speaking, the weather is bad. A fool, to speak generally, is vain.",
"genteel" 		: "Genteel|This word, meaning polite, or well mannered, was once in better repute than it is now, and its noun, gentility, is still not infrequently found in the work of good writers. Genteel is most often used by those who write, as the Scotchman of the anecdote joked--wi\" deeficulty.",
"gentleman" 	: "Gentleman|It is not possible to teach the correct use of this overworked word: one must be bred to it. Everybody knows that it is not synonymous with man, but among the \"genteel\" and those ambitious to be thought \"genteel\" it is commonly so used in discourse too formal for the word \"gent.\" To use the word gentleman correctly, be one.",
"genuine" 		: "Genuine for Authentic|or Veritable. \"A genuine document,\" \"a genuine surprise,\" and the like.",
"given" 		: "Given|\"The soldier was given a rifle.\" What was given is the rifle, not the soldier. \"The house was given a coat (coating) of paint.\" Nothing can be \"given\" anything.",
"goatee" 		: "Goatee|In this country goatee is frequently used for a tuft of beard on the point of the chin--what is sometimes called \"an imperial,\" apparently because the late Emperor Napoleon III wore his beard so. His Majesty the Goat is graciously pleased to wear his beneath the chin.",
"got married" 	: "Got Married for Married|If this is correct we should say, also, \"got dead\" for died; one expression is as good as the other.",
"gotten" 		: "Gotten for Got|This has gone out of good use, though in such compounded words as begotten and misbegotten it persists respectably.",
"gratuitous" 	: "Gratuitous for Unwarranted|\"A gratuitous assertion.\" Gratuitous means without cost.",
"grueling" 		: "Grueling|Used chiefly by newspaper reporters; as, \"He was subjected to a grueling cross-examination.\" \"It was grueling weather.\" Probably a corruption of grilling.",
"gubernatorial" : "Gubernatorial|Eschew it; it is not English, is needless and bombastic. Leave it to those who call a political office a \"chair.\" \"Gubernatorial chair\" is good enough for them. So is hanging.",
"had Better" 	: "Had Better for Would Better|This is not defensible as an idiom, as those who always used it before their attention was directed to it take the trouble to point out. It comes of such contractions as he\"d for he would, I\"d for I would. These clipped words are erroneously restored as \"he had,\" \"I had.\" So we have such monstrosities as \"He had better beware,\" \"I had better go.\" ",
"hail" 			: "Hail for Come|\"He hails from Chicago.\" This is sea speech, and comes from the custom of hailing passing ships. It will not do for serious discourse.",
"have got" 		: "Have Got for Have|\"I have got a good horse\" directs attention rather to the act of getting than to the state of having, and represents the capture as recently completed.",
"head over heels" : "Head over Heels|A transposition of words hardly less surprising than (to the person most concerned) the mischance that it fails to describe. What is meant is heels over head.",
"healthy" 		: "Healthy for Wholesome|\"A healthy climate.\" \"A healthy occupation.\" Only a living thing can be healthy.",
"helpmeet" 		: "Helpmeet for Helpmate|In Genesis Adam\"s wife is called \"an help meet for him,\" that is, fit for him. The ridiculous word appears to have had no other origin.",
"hereafter" 	: "Hereafter for Henceforth|Hereafter means at some time in the future; henceforth, always in the future. The penitent who promises to be good hereafter commits himself to the performance of a single good act, not to a course of good conduct.",
"honeymoon" 	: "Honeymoon|Moon here means month, so it is incorrect to say, \"a week\"s honeymoon,\" or, \"Their honeymoon lasted a year.\"",
"horseflesh" 	: "Horseflesh for Horses|A singularly senseless and disagreeable word which, when used, as it commonly is, with reference to hippophilism, savors rather more of the spit than of the spirit.",
"humans" 		: "Humans as a Noun. We have no single word having the general yet limited meaning that this is sometimes used to express--a meaning corresponding to that of the word animals, as the word men would if it included women and children. But there is time enough to use two words.",
"hung" 			: "Hung for Hanged|A bell, or a curtain, is hung, but a man is hanged. Hung is the junior form of the participle, and is now used for everything but man. Perhaps it is our reverence for the custom of hanging men that sacredly preserves the elder form--as some, even, of the most zealous American spelling reformers still respect the u in Saviour.",
"hurry" 		: "Hurry for Haste and Hasten|To hurry is to hasten in a more or less disorderly manner. Hurry is misused, also, in another sense: \"There is no hurry\"--meaning, There is no reason for haste.",
"hurt" 			: "Hurt for Harm|\"It does no hurt.\" To be hurt is to feel pain, but one may be harmed without knowing it. To spank a child, or flout a fool, hurts without harming.",
"idea" 			: "Idea for Thought, Purpose, Expectation|etc. \"I had no idea that it was so cold.\" \"When he went abroad it was with no idea of remaining.\"",
"identified with" : "Identified with|\"He is closely identified with the temperance movement.\" Say, connected.",
"ilk" 			: "Ilk for Kind|\"Men of that ilk.\" This Scotch word has a narrowly limited and specific meaning. It relates to an ancestral estate having the same name as the person spoken of. Macdonald of that ilk means, Macdonald of Macdonald. The phrase quoted above is without meaning.",
"illy" 			: "Illy for Ill|There is no such word as illy, for ill itself is an adverb.",
"imaginary line": "Imaginary Line|The adjective is needless. Geometrically, every line is imaginary; its graphic representation is a mark. True the text-books say, draw a line, but in a mathematical sense the line already exists; the drawing only makes its course visible.",
"inaugurate" 	: "Inaugurate for Begin, Establish, etc. Inauguration implies some degree of formality and ceremony.",
"incumbent" 	: "Incumbent for Obligatory|\"It was incumbent upon me to relieve him.\" Infelicitous and work-worn. Say, It was my duty, or, if enamored of that particular metaphor, It lay upon me.",
"individual" 	: "Individual|As a noun, this word means something that cannot be considered as divided, a unit. But it is incorrect to call a man, woman or child an individual, except with reference to mankind, to society or to a class of persons. It will not do to say, \"An individual stood in the street,\" when no mention nor allusion has been made, nor is going to be made, to some aggregate of individuals considered as a whole.",
"insane Asylum" : "Insane Asylum|Obviously an asylum cannot be unsound in mind. Say, asylum for the insane.",

"inside of" 	: "Inside of|Omit the preposition.",
"insignificant" : "Insignificant for Trivial or Small|Insignificant means not signifying anything, and should be used only in contrast, expressed or implied, with something that is important for what it implies. The bear\"s tail may be insignificant to a naturalist tracing the animal\"s descent from an earlier species, but to the rest of us, not concerned with the matter, it is merely small.",
"insoluble" 	: "Insoluble for Unsolvable|Use the former word for material substances, the latter for problems.",
"integrity" 	: "Integrity for Honesty|The word means entireness, wholeness. It may be rightly used to affirm possession of all the virtues, that is, unity of moral character.",
"involve" 		: "Involve for Entail|\"Proof of the charges will involve his dismissal.\" Not at all; it will entail it. To involve is, literally, to infold, not to bring about, nor cause to ensue. An unofficial investigation, for example, may involve character and reputation, but the ultimate consequence is entailed. A question, in the parliamentary sense, may involve a principle; its settlement one way or another may entail expense, or injury to interests. An act may involve one\"s honor and entail disgrace.",
"item" 			: "Item for Brief Article|Commonly used of a narrative in a newspaper. Item connotes an aggregate of which it is a unit--one thing of many. Hence it suggests more than we may wish to direct attention to.",
"jeopardize" 	: "Jeopardize for Imperil or Endanger|The correct word is jeopard, but in any case there is no need for anything so farfetched and stilted.",
"juncture" 		: "Juncture|Juncture means a joining, a junction; its use to signify a time, however critical a time, is absurd. \"At this juncture the woman screamed.\" In reading that account of it we scream too.",
"just Exactly" 	: "Just Exactly|Nothing is gained in strength nor precision by this kind of pleonasm. Omit just.",
"juvenile" : "Juvenile for Child|This needless use of the adjective for the noun is probably supposed to be humorous, like \"canine\" for dog, \"optic\" for eye, \"anatomy\" for body, and the like. Happily the offense is not very common.",
"kind of a" : "Kind of a for Kind of|\"He was that kind of a man.\" Say that kind of man. Man here is generic, and a genus comprises many kinds. But there cannot be more than one kind of one thing. Kind of followed by an adjective, as, \"kind of good,\" is almost too gross for censure.",
"landed Estate" : "Landed Estate for Property in Land|Dreadful!",
"later on" : "Later on|On is redundant; say, later.",
"laundry" : "Laundry|Meaning a place where clothing is washed, this word cannot mean, also, clothing sent there to be washed.",
"lay (to place) for Lie (to recline)" : "Lay (to place) for Lie (to recline). \"The ship lays on her side.\" A more common error is made in the past tense, as, \"He laid down on the grass.\" The confusion comes of the identity of a present tense of the transitive verb to lay and the past tense of the intransitive verb to lie.",
"leading Question" : "Leading Question|A leading question is not necessarily an important one; it is one that is so framed as to suggest, or lead to, the answer desired. Few others than lawyers use the term correctly.",
"lease" : "Lease|To say of a man that he leases certain premises leaves it doubtful whether he is lessor or lessee. Being ambiguous, the word should be used with caution.",
"leave" : "Leave for Go away|\"He left yesterday.\" Leave is a transitive verb; name the place of departure. Leave for Let \"Leave it alone.\" By this many persons mean, not that it is to be left in solitude, but that it is to be untouched, or unmolested.",
"lengthways" : "Lengthways for Lengthwise|",
"lengthy" : "Lengthy|Usually said in disparagement of some wearisome discourse. It is no better than breadthy, or thicknessy.",
"leniency" : "Leniency for Lenity|The words are synonymous, but the latter is the better.",
"less" : "Less for Fewer|\"The regiment had less than five hundred men.\" Less relates to quantity, fewer, to number.",
"limited" : "Limited for Small, Inadequate etc. |\"The army\"s operations were confined to a limited area.\" \"We had a limited supply of food.\" A large area and an adequate supply would also be limited. Everything that we know about is limited.",
"liable" : "Liable for Likely|\"Man is liable to err.\" Man is not liable to err, but to error. Liable should be followed, not by an infinitive, but by a preposition.",
"likely" : "Likely for Probably|\"He will likely be elected.\" If likely is thought the better word (and in most cases it is) put it this way: \"It is likely that he will be elected,\" or, \"He is likely to be elected.\"",
"literally" : "Literally for Figuratively|\"The stream was literally alive with fish.\" \"His eloquence literally swept the audience from its feet.\" It is bad enough to exaggerate, but to affirm the truth of the exaggeration is intolerable.",
"loan" : "Loan for Lend|\"I loaned him ten dollars.\" We lend, but the act of lending, or, less literally, the thing lent, is a loan.",
"locate" : "Locate|\"After many removals the family located at Smithville.\" Some dictionaries give locate as an intransitive verb having that meaning, but--well, dictionaries are funny.",
"maintain" : "Maintain for Contend|\"The senator maintained that the tariff was iniquitous.\" He maintained it only if he proved it.",
"majority" : "Majority for Plurality|Concerning votes cast in an election, a majority is more than half the total; a plurality is the excess of one candidate\"s votes over another\"s. Commonly the votes compared are those for the successful candidate and those for his most nearly successful competitor.",
"mend" : "Mend for Repair|\"They mended the road.\" To mend is to repair, but to repair is not always to mend. A stocking is mended, a road repaired.",
"militate" : "Militate|\"Negligence militates against success.\" If \"militate\" meant anything it would mean fight, but there is no such word.",
"mind" : "Mind for Obey|This is a reasonless extension of one legitimate meaning of mind, namely, to heed, to give attention.",
"moneyed" : "Moneyed for Wealthy|\"The moneyed men of New York.\" One might as sensibly say, \"The cattled men of Texas,\" or, \"The lobstered men of the fish market.\"",
"mutual" : "Mutual|By this word we express a reciprocal relation. It implies exchange, a giving and taking, not a mere possessing in common. There can be a mutual affection, or a mutual hatred, but not a mutual friend, nor a mutual horse.",
"negotiate" : "Negotiate From the Latin negotium|It means, as all know, to fix the terms for a transaction, to bargain. But when we say, \"The driver negotiated a difficult turn of the road,\" or, \"The chauffeur negotiated a hill,\" we speak nonsense.",
"nice" : "Nice for Good or Agreeable|\"A nice girl.\" Nice means fastidious, delicately discriminative, and the like. Pope uses the word admirably of a dandy who was skilled in the nice conduct [management] of a clouded cane.",
"noise" : "Noise for Sound|\"A noise like a flute\"; \"a noise of twittering birds,\" etc. A noise is a loud or disagreeable sound, or combination or succession of sounds.",
"none" : "None|Usually, and in most cases, singular; as, None has come. But it is not singular because it always means not one, for frequently it does not, as, The bottle was full of milk, but none is left. When it refers to numbers, not quantity, popular usage stubbornly insists that it is plural, and at least one respectable authority says that as a singular it is offensive. One is sorry to be offensive to a good man.",
"numerous" : "Numerous for Many|Rightly used, numerous relates to numbers, but does not imply a great number. A correct use is seen in the term numerous verse--verse consisting of poetic numbers; that is, rhythmical feet.",
"obnoxious" : "Obnoxious for Offensive|Obnoxious means exposed to evil. A soldier in battle is obnoxious to danger.",
"occasion" : "Occasion for Induce or Cause|\"His arrival occasioned a great tumult.\" As a verb, the word is needless and unpleasing.",
"one another" : "One Another for Each Other|\"The three looked at each other.\" That is, each looked at the other. But there were more than one other; so we should say they looked at one another, which means that each looked at another. Of two, say each other; of more than two, one another.",
"opine" : "Opine for Think|The word is not very respectably connected.",
"opposite" : "Opposite for Contrary|\"I hold the opposite opinion.\" \"The opposite practice.\"",
"ordinarily" : "Ordinarily for Usually|Clumsy.",
"ovation" : "Ovation|In ancient Rome an ovation was an inferior triumph accorded to victors in minor wars or unimportant battle. Its character and limitations, like those of the triumph, were strictly defined by law and custom. An enthusiastic demonstration in honor of an American civilian is nothing like that, and should not be called by its name. ",
"outside of" : "Outside of|Omit the preposition.",
"partially" : "Partially for Partly|A dictionary word, to swell the book.",
"peculiar" : "Peculiar for Odd or Unusual|Also sometimes used to denote distinction, or particularity. Properly a thing is peculiar only to another thing, of which it is characteristic, nothing else having it; as knowledge of the use of fire is peculiar to Man.",
"perpetually" : "Perpetually for Continually|\"The child is perpetually asking questions.\" What is done perpetually is done continually and forever.",
"phenomenal" : "Phenomenal for Extraordinary or Surprising|Everything that occurs is phenomenal, for all that we know about is phenomena, appearances. Of realities, noumena, we are ignorant.",

"plenty" : "Plenty for Plentiful|\"Fish and fowl were plenty.\"",
"poetess" : "Poetess|A foolish word, like \"authoress.\"",
"poetry" : "Poetry for Verse|Not all verse is poetry; not all poetry is verse. Few persons can know, or hope to know, the one from the other, but he who has the humility to doubt (if such a one there be) should say verse if the composition is metrical.",
"point Blank" : "Point Blank|\"He fired at him point blank.\" This usually is intended to mean directly, or at short range. But point blank means the point at which the line of sight is crossed downward by the trajectory--the curve described by the missile.",
"poisonous" : "Poisonous for Venomous|Hemlock is poisonous, but a rattlesnake is venomous.",
"possess" : "Possess for Have|\"To possess knowledge is to possess power.\" Possess is lacking in naturalness and unduly emphasizes the concept of ownership.",
"practically" : "Practically for Virtually|This error is very common. \"It is practically conceded.\" \"The decision was practically unanimous.\" \"The panther and the cougar are practically the same animal.\" These and similar misapplications of the word are virtually without excuse.",
"predicate" : "Predicate for Found or Base|\"I predicate my argument on universal experience.\" What is predicated of something is affirmed as an attribute of it, as omnipotence is predicated of the Deity.",
"prejudice" : "Prejudice for Prepossession|Literally, a prejudice is merely a prejudgment--a decision before evidence--and may be favorable or unfavorable, but it is so much more frequently used in the latter sense than in the former that clarity is better got by the other word for reasonless approval.",
"preparedness" : "Preparedness for Readiness|An awkward and needless word much used in discussion of national armaments, as, \"Our preparedness for war.\"",
"preside" : "Preside|\"Professor Swackenhauer presided at the piano.\" \"The deviled crab table was presided over by Mrs. Dooley.\" How would this sound? \"The ginger pop stand was under the administration of President Woolwit, and Professor Sooffle presided at the flute.\"",
"pretend" : "Pretend for Profess|\"I do not pretend to be infallible.\" Of course not; one does not care to confess oneself a pretender. To pretend is to try to deceive; one may profess quite honestly.",
"preventative" : "Preventative for Preventive|No such word as preventative.",
"prior to" : "Prior to for Before|Stilted.",
"propose" : "Propose for Purpose or Intend|\"I propose to go to Europe.\" A mere intention is not a proposal.",
"proposition" : "Proposition for Proposal|\"He made a proposition.\" In current slang almost anything is a proposition. A difficult enterprise is \"a tough proposition,\" an agile wrestler, \"a slippery proposition,\" and so forth.",
"proportions" : "Proportions for Dimensions|\"A rock of vast proportions.\" Proportions relate to form; dimensions to magnitude.",
"proven" : "Proven for Proved|Good Scotch, but bad English.",
"proverbial" : "Proverbial for Familiar|\"The proverbial dog in the manger.\" The animal is not \"proverbial\" for it is not mentioned in a proverb, but in a fable.",
"quit" : "Quit for Cease/Stop|\"Jones promises to quit drinking.\" In another sense, too, the word is commonly misused, as, \"He has quit the town.\" Say, quitted.",
"quite" : "Quite|\"She is quite charming.\" If it is meant that she is entirely charming this is right, but usually the meaning intended to be conveyed is less than that--that she is rather, or somewhat, charming.",
"raise" : "Raise for Bring up, Grow, Breed etc.|In this country a word-of-all-work: \"raise children,\" \"raise wheat,\" \"raise cattle.\" Children are brought up, grain, hay and vegetables are grown, animals and poultry are bred.",
"real" : "Real for Really or Very|\"It is real good of him.\" \"The weather was real cold.\"",
"realize" : "Realize for Conceive or Comprehend|\"I could not realize the situation.\" Writers caring for precision use this word in the sense of to make real, not to make seem real. A dream seems real, but is actually realized when made to come true.",
"recollect" : "Recollect for Remember|To remember is to have in memory; to recollect is to recall what has escaped from memory. We remember automatically; in recollecting we make a conscious effort.",
"redeem" : "Redeem for Retrieve|\"He redeemed his good name.\" Redemption (Latin redemptio,from re and dimere) is allied to ransom, and carries the sense of buying back; whereas to retrieve is merely to recover what was lost.",
"redound" : "Redound for Conduce|\"A man\"s honesty redounds to his advantage.\" We make a better use of the word if we say of one (for example) who has squandered a fortune, that its loss redounds to his advantage, for the word denotes a fluctuation, as from seeming evil to actual good; as villification may direct attention to one\"s excellent character.",
"refused" : "Refused|\"He was refused a crown.\" It is the crown that was refused to him.",
"regular" : "Regular for Natural or Customary|\"Flattery of the people is the demagogue\"s regular means to political preferment.\" Regular properly relates to a rule (regula) more definite than the law of antecedent and consequent.",
"reliable" : "Reliable for Trusty or Trustworthy|A word not yet admitted to the vocabulary of the fastidious, but with a strong backing for the place.",
"remit" : "Remit for Send|\"On receiving your bill I will remit the money.\" Remit does not mean that; it means give back, yield up, relinquish, etc. It means, also, to cancel, as in the phrase, the remission of sins.",
"rendition" : "Rendition for Interpretation or Performance|\"The actor\"s rendition of the part was good.\" Rendition means a surrender, or a giving back.",
"reportorial" : "Reportorial|A vile word, improperly made. It assumes the Latinized spelling, \"reporter.\" The Romans had not the word, for they were, fortunately for them, without the thing.",
"repudiate" : "Repudiate for Deny|\"He repudiated the accusation.\"",
"reside" : "Reside for Live|\"They reside in Hohokus.\" Stilted.",
"residence" : "Residence for Dwelling or House.",
"respect" : "Respect for Way or Matter|\"They were alike in that respect.\" The misuse comes of abbreviating: the sentence properly written might be, They were alike in respect of that--i.e., with regard to that. The word in the bad sense has even been pluralized: \"In many respects it is admirable.\"",
"respective" : "Respective|\"They went to their respective homes.\" The adjective here (if an adjective is thought necessary) should be several. In the adverbial form the word is properly used in the sentence following: John and James are bright and dull, respectively. That is, John is bright and James dull.",
"responsible" : "Responsible|\"The bad weather is responsible for much sickness.\" \"His intemperance was responsible for his crime.\" Responsibility is not an attribute of anything but human beings, and few of these can respond, in damages or otherwise. Responsible is nearly synonymous with accountable and answerable, which, also, are frequently misused.",
"restive" : "Restive for Restless|These words have directly contrary meanings; the dictionaries\" disallowance of their identity would be something to be thankful for, but that is a dream.",
"retire" : "Retire for Go to Bed English of the \"genteel\" sort.",
"ride" : "Ride for Drive|On horseback one does drive, and in a vehicle one does ride, but a distinction is needed here, as in England; so, here as there, we may profitably make it, riding in the saddle and driving in the carriage.",
"roomer" : "Roomer for Lodger|See Bedder and Mealer--if you can find them.",
"round" : "Round for About|\"They stood round.\"",
"ruination" : "Ruination for Ruin|Questionably derived and problematically needful.",
"run" : "Run for Manage or Conduct|Vulgar--hardly better than slang.",
"scholar" : "Scholar for Student or Pupil|A scholar is a person who is learned, not a person who is learning.",
"score" : "Score for Win, Obtain, etc.|\"He scored an advantage over his opponent.\" To score is not to win a point, but to record it.",
"second-handed" : "Second-handed for Second-hand|There is no such word.",
"secure" : "Secure for Procure|\"He secured a position as book-keeper.\" \"The dwarf secured a stick and guarded the jewels that he had found.\" Then it was the jewels that were secured.",
"seldom ever" : "Seldom ever|A most absurd locution.",
"self-confessed" : "Self-confessed|\"A self-confessed assassin.\" Self is superfluous: one\"s sins cannot be confessed by another.",
"sensation" : "Sensation for Emotion|\"The play caused a great sensation.\" \"A sensational newspaper.\" A sensation is a physical feeling; an emotion, a mental. Doubtless the one usually accompanies the other, but the good writer will name the one that he has in mind, not the other. There are few errors more common than the one here noted.",
"sense" : "Sense for Smell|\"She sensed the fragrance of roses.\" Society English.",
"settee" : "Settee for Settle|This word belongs to the peasantry of speech.",
"settle" : "Settle for Pay|\"Settle the bill.\" \"I shall take it now and settle for it later.\"",
"shades" : "Shades for Shade|\"Shades of Noah! how it rained!\" \"O shades of Caesar!\" A shade is a departed soul, as conceived by the ancients; one to each mortal part is the proper allowance.",
"sick" : "Sick for Ill|Good usage now limits this word to cases of nausea, but it is still legitimate in sickly, sickness, love-sick, and the like.",
"sideburns" : "Sideburns for Burnsides|A form of whiskers named from a noted general of the civil war, Ambrose E. Burnside. It seems to be thought that the word side has something to do with it, and that as an adjective it should come first, according to our idiom.",
"side-hill" : "Side-hill for Hillside|A reasonless transposition for which it is impossible to assign a cause, unless it is abbreviated from side o\" the hill.",
"smart" : "Smart for Bright or Able|An Americanism that is dying out. But \"smart\" has recently come into use for fashionable, which is almost as bad.",
"snap" : "Snap for Period (of time) or Spell|\"A cold snap.\" This is a word of incomprehensible origin in that sense; we can know only that its parents were not respectable. \"Spell\" is itself not very well-born.",
"solemnize" : "Solemnize|This word rightly means to make solemn, not to perform, or celebrate, ceremoniously something already solemn, as a marriage, or a mass. We have no exact synonym, but this explains, rather than justifies, its use.",
"space" : "Space for Period|\"A long space of time.\" Space is so different a thing from time that the two do not go well together.",
"state" : "State for Say|\"He stated that he came from Chicago.\" \"It is stated that the president is angry.\" We state a proposition, or a principle, but say that we are well. And we say our prayers--some of us.",
"stunt" : "Stunt|A word recently introduced and now overworked, meaning a task, or performance in one\"s trade, or calling,--doubtless a variant of stint, without that word\"s suggestion of allotment and limitation. It is still in the reptilian stage of evolution.",
"subsequent" : "Subsequent for Later or Succeeding|Legitimate enough, but ugly and needless. \"He was subsequently hanged.\" Say, afterward.",
"substantiate" : "Substantiate for Prove|Why?",
"success" : "Success|\"The project was a success.\" Say, was successful. Success should not have the indefinite article.",
"suicided" : "Suicide|This is never a verb. \"He suicided.\" Say, He killed himself, or He took his own life.",
"survive" : "Survive for Live or Persist|Survival is an outliving, or outlasting of something else. \"The custom survives\" is wrong, but a custom may survive its utility. Survive is a transitive verb.",
"sustain" : "Sustain for Incur|\"He sustained an injury.\" \"He sustained a broken neck.\" That means that although his neck was broken he did not yield to the mischance.",
"talented" : "Talented for Gifted|These are both past participles, but there was once the verb to gift, whereas there was never the verb \"to talent.\" If Nature did not talent a person the person is not talented.",
"tantamount" : "Tantamount for Equivalent|\"Apology is tantamount to confession.\" Let this ugly word alone; it is not only illegitimate, but ludicrously suggests catamount.",
"tear down" : "Tear Down for Pull Down|\"The house was torn down.\" This is an indigenous solecism; they do not say so in England.",
"the Following" : "The Following|\"Washington wrote the following.\" The following what? Put in the noun. \"The following animals are ruminants.\" It is not the animals that follow, but their names.",
"the Same" : "The Same|\"They cooked the flesh of the lion and ate the same.\" \"An old man lived in a cave, and the same was a cripple.\" In humorous composition this may do, though it is not funny; but in serious work use the regular pronoun.",
"those Kind" : "Those Kind for That Kind|\"Those kind of things.\" Almost too absurd for condemnation, and happily not very common out of the class of analphabets.",
"transaction" : "Transaction for Action or Incident|\"The policeman struck the man with his club, but the transaction was not reported.\" \"The picking of a pocket is a criminal transaction.\" In a transaction two or more persons must have an active or assenting part; as, a business transaction, Transactions of the Geographical Society, etc. The Society\"s action would be better called Proceedings.",
"transpire" : "Transpire for Occur, Happen, etc.|\"This event transpired in 1906.\" Transpire (trans: through, and spirare: to breathe) means leak out, that is, become known. What transpired in 1906 may have occurred long before.",
"trifling" : "Trifling for Trivial|\"A trifling defect\"; \"a trifling error.\"",
"try an Experiment" : "Try an Experiment|An experiment is a trial; we cannot try a trial. Say, make.",
"try and" : "Try and for Try to|\"I will try and see him.\" This plainly says that my effort to see him will succeed--which I cannot know and do not wish to affirm. \"Please try and come.\" This colloquial slovenliness of speech is almost universal in this country, but freedom of speech is one of our most precious possessions.",
"unique" : "Unique|\"This is very unique. The most unique house in the city.\" There are no degrees of uniqueness: a thing is unique if there is not another like it. The word has nothing to do with oddity, strangeness, nor picturesqueness.",
"unkempt" : "Unkempt for Disordered/Untidy/etc. Unkempt means uncombed, and can properly be said of nothing but the hair.",
"utter" : "Utter for Absolute, Entire, etc.|Utter has a damnatory signification and is to be used of evil things only. It is correct to say utter misery, but not \"utter happiness;\" utterly bad, but not \"utterly good.\"",
"various" : "Various for Several|\"Various kinds of men.\" Kinds are various of course, for they vary--that is what makes them kinds. Use various only when, in speaking of a number of things, you wish to direct attention to their variety--their difference, one from another. \"The dividend was distributed among the various stockholders.\" The stockholders vary, as do all persons, but that is irrelevant and was not in mind. \"Various persons have spoken to me of you.\" Their variation is unimportant; what is meant is that there was a small indefinite number of them; that is, several.",
"ventilate" : "Ventilate for Express, Disclose|etc. \"The statesman ventilated his views.\" A disagreeable and dog-eared figure of speech.",
"verbal" : "Verbal for Oral|All language is verbal, whether spoken or written, but audible speech is oral. \"He did not write, but communicated his wishes verbally.\" It would have been a verbal communication, also, if written.",
"vest" : "Vest for Waistcoat|This is American, but as all Americans are not in agreement about it it is better to use the English word.",
"vicinity" : "Vicinity for Vicinage or Neighborhood|\"He lives in this vicinity.\" If neither of the other words is desired say, He lives in the vicinity of this place, or, better, He lives near by.",
"view of" : "View of|\"He invested with the view of immediate profit.\" \"He enlisted with the view of promotion.\" Say, with a view to.",
"vulgar" : "Vulgar for Immodest, Indecent|It is from vulgus: the common people, the mob, and means both common and unrefined, but has no relation to indecency.",
"wed" : "Wed for Wedded|\"They were wed at noon.\" \"He wed her in Boston.\" The word wed in all its forms as a substitute for marry, is pretty hard to bear.",
"well," : "Well|As a mere meaningless prelude to a sentence this word is overtasked. \"Well, I don\"t know about that.\" \"Well, you may try.\" \"Well, have your own way.\"",
"whiskers" : "Whiskers for Beard|The whisker is that part of the beard that grows on the cheek.",
"who" : "Who for Whom|If this object of the sentence is 'Him', then use whom, if 'He' then use who.",
"whom" : "Whom for Who|\"The man whom they thought was dead is living.\" Here the needless introduction of was entails the alteration of whom to who. \"Remember whom it is that you speak of.\" \"George Washington, than whom there was no greater man, loved a jest.\" The misuse of whom after than is almost universal. Who and whom trip up many a good writer, although, unlike which and who, they require nothing but knowledge of grammar.",
"widow Woman" : "Widow Woman|Omit woman.",
"will and Shall" : "Will and Shall|Proficiency in the use of these apparently troublesome words must be sought in text-books on grammar and rhetoric, where the subject will be found treated with a more particular attention, and at greater length, than is possible in a book of the character of this. Briefly and generally, in the first person, a mere intention is indicated by shall, as, I shall go; whereas will denotes some degree of compliance or determination, as, I will go--as if my going had been requested or forbidden. In the second and the third person, will merely forecasts, as, You (or he) will go; but shall implies something of promise, permission or compulsion by the speaker, as, You (or he) shall go. Another and less obvious compulsion--that of circumstance--speaks in shall, as sometimes used with good effect: In Germany you shall not turn over a chip without uncovering a philosopher. The sentence is barely more than indicative, shall being almost, but not quite, equivalent to can.",
"win out" : "Win out|Like its antithesis, \"lose out,\" this reasonless phrase is of sport, \"sporty.\"",
"witness" : "Witness for See|To witness is more than merely to see, or observe; it is to observe, and to tell afterward.",
"would-be" : "Would-be|\"The would-be assassin was arrested.\" The word doubtless supplies a want, but we can better endure the want than the word. In the instance of the assassin, it is needless, for he who attempts to murder is an assassin, whether he succeeds or not. "
