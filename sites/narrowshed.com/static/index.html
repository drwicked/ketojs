There are two kinds:  You’re stuck, or the work is.  You’re stuck whenever you’re doing something you don’t want to.  If you’re eating chocolate chip cookies and really wish you weren’t, if you’re grazing over articles or pintrest or doing the dishes when you want to be writing, you’re scrambling frantically to make a deadline, again.  You’re stuck in traffic, you’re stuck in a shitty marriage. You know the feeling. If not, try the construction this way:  you’re stuck whenever you’re not doing something you want to do.  You’re not writing scene three, you’re not starting the new book, you’re not doing enough self-promotion.  </p><p id="q1bDescribe" style="display:none">Maybe you’re doing what you want, but not the way you want to --  you’re not writing quickly enough, you’re not selling enough copies of your book, you’re not enjoying your work – write that down</p><p id="q1cDescribe" style="display:none">Sometimes you’re not stuck, but something is. Stuckness outside you looks like this:  my book, my child, scene three, my protagonist isn’t doing what I want them to, is doing something I don’t want them to, or isn’t doing what I want the way I want them to. Whatever it is, write it down.</p><p class="subDescribe">Whatever it is, write it down, and write it in the negative:  </p><input type="text" id="q1" placeholder="I'm not [verbing]"/><div id="subQuestionLink" class="pointer">This question isn't quite right.</div><div id="subQuestions" style="display:none"><a onclick="console.log('clickety');$('#q1bDescribe').show();">I'm doing what I want, but I'm not doing it how I want to.<br/></a><a onclick="console.log('clickety');$('#q1cDescribe').show();">My stuckness is outside me.</a></div><div id="start2" onclick="$('#q2section').show()" style="display:none" class="nextLink">Next</div></div><div id="q2section" style="display:none"><h3>A game for getting unstuck</h3><p id="q2aDescribe">Being stuck is all about feeling powerless.  These games are tricks for luring your power back from the places it’s most likely to hide. They’re games because games are fun, and power likes fun.  Because games are voluntary and power, while it does mind applying force, will not be coerced.  Because games have rules, and power feels at home with rules. Because games have opposition, and opposition strengthens power. Because games have a goal, and power likes a clear path. And because games can be won, and power loves to win!</p><h3>Games have goals:</h3><p class="subDescribe">Your current stuckness statement is <div id='q1restate'></div></p><p class="subDescribe">Rewrite your stuckness statement this way:</p><input type="text" id="q2" placeholder="I want [him, her, it] to [verb] [adverbly]." class="questionInput"/><br/><div class="sentenceText">I want </div><input type="text" id="subject" placeholder="[outside]" class="sentenceInput"/><div class="sentenceText">to</div><input type="text" id="verb" placeholder="[verb]" class="sentenceInput"/><input type="text" id="adverb" placeholder="[adverb]" class="sentenceInput"/><div id="start3" onclick="$('#q3section').show()" class="nextLink">Next</div></div><div id="q3section" style="display:none"><h3>Games can be won:</h3><p class="subDescribe">The verb of your game goal statement is your golden snitch.
